<p align="center"><b>Fig.</b> The detailed network architecture of our Fixation Shifting Network (FishNet). Our FishNet has three major components:</p>

1. **Component A**: Focuses on performing ERP-based global feature embedding to achieve panoptic perception and avoid visual distortion.  
2. **Component B**: Catches fixation shifting in PanopticVideo-300 by refocusing the network to avoid the compression problem of shifted fixations in SOTA models.  
3. **Component C**: Makes the network fully aware of and learns the fixation shifting mechanism to ensure that the network is sensitive to fixation shifting.
